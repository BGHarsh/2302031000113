                    <h3>Step 1: Power Off Your Phone</h3>
                    <p>Before beginning any work, power off your phone to avoid short circuits or electrical shock.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="step">
                    <h3>Step 2: Remove the SIM Card Tray (If Needed/optional)</h3>
                    <p>Some phones require the SIM card tray to be removed before disassembling. Use the SIM card ejector tool to take it out.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="step">
                    <h3>Step 3: Heat the Back Cover (If Necessary)</h3>
                    <p>If your phone has a glued or adhesive-sealed back cover, apply a little heat using a heat pad or a hairdryer. This will soften the adhesive, making it easier to open. Heat for about 30 seconds to 1 minute.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="step">
                    <h3>Step 4: Pry Open the Back Cover</h3>
                    <p>Using a plastic pry tool or suction cup, carefully separate the back cover from the phone. Be gentle to avoid cracking the cover or damaging any components. Work your way around the phone, loosening the adhesive, until the back cover is removed.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="step">
                    <h3>Step 5: Unscrew the Internal Screws</h3>
                    <p>Most phones will have screws securing the internal components. Using the appropriate screwdriver, remove the screws. Keep track of the different screw sizes and where they belong.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="step">
                    <h3>Step 6: Disconnect the Battery Connector</h3>
                    <p>Once the screws are removed, locate the battery connector (usually covered with a small protective plastic cover). Use a plastic tool to gently lift the connector from its port. Be cautious not to damage any connectors or cables.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="step">
                    <h3>Step 7: Remove the Old Battery</h3>
                    <p>If the battery is glued in place, use the plastic pry tool or suction cup to gently lift the battery. If there is any resistance, apply a little heat to soften the adhesive further. Once free, carefully remove the old battery.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="step">
                    <h3>Step 8: Install the New Battery</h3>
                    <p>Place the new battery into the compartment, aligning it properly. Reconnect the battery's connector to the phone's motherboard. Make sure it's securely connected.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="step">
                    <h3>Step 9: Reassemble the Phone</h3>
                    <p>Once the battery is connected, start reassembling the phone. Place the back cover on and gently press it to secure it. If there are screws, replace them in their original spots. If the back cover is glued, make sure it's aligned correctly.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="step">
                    <h3>Step 10: Power On the Phone</h3>
                    <p>Turn your phone back on to check that the battery is properly installed. Make sure it is charging and working properly.</p>
